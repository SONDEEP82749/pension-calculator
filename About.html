Your site is under review. What’s next?



We're currently reviewing your site, which can take up to four weeks. While you wait, here are some helpful tips to prepare your site for success with AdSense.


Check that your content:

•	Is original, high-quality and relevant to your audience
•	Adheres to AdSense programme policies and avoids restricted content like adult material, violence or hate speech
•	Includes an ‘About Us’ and ‘Contact Us’ page – they’re essential for transparency and user trust


Optimise your site:

•	Is your site easy to navigate, with clear menus and links?
•	Does it load quickly on both desktop and mobile devices?
•	Have you implemented basic SEO practices to attract more visitors?


Consider using the following to show your commitment to quality:

•	Diverse and engaging content in a variety of formats (articles, images and videos).
•	Regular site updates featuring fresh content posted on a consistent schedule
AdSense policies: A beginner’s guide



Clicks and impressions


Avoid clicking your own ads or encouraging others to. Use Google Analytics to understand your traffic.



Content guidelines


You're responsible for all site content displayed alongside AdSense ads, so you should ensure that it's original, relevant and valuable to users.



Ad implementation


Avoid altering the AdSense code, using pop-ups or software installations, or mimicking Google's branding without permission.



Disabled ads or account


Keep your contact information current and promptly address any policy issues or requests from AdSense.

The message you got from Google AdSense is normal — it means your site (https://pencalculator.startknowledge.in) is under review, and Google is checking whether your site meets AdSense approval requirements.

Let’s check step-by-step whether everything is ready and what you need to fix 👇

✅ 1. Confirm AdSense code is properly added
Go to your AdSense account → Sites → pencalculator.startknowledge.in → check if the status is “Getting ready” or “Under review.”

Make sure you pasted your AdSense verification code (<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=pub-2162324894765763" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>)
inside the <head> tag of your homepage (like index.html).

📋 Example:

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=pub-2162324894765763" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
  <title>Pension Calculator</title>
</head>
✅ 2. Your site must have these pages (required for AdSense)
Make sure your site includes working links to:

Page Name	Purpose	URL Example
About Us	Who you are, what the site offers	/about.html
Contact Us	Email form or email ID	/contact.html
Privacy Policy	Mandatory for AdSense	/privacy-policy.html
Terms & Conditions	Optional but helpful	/terms.html
💡 If any of these are missing, Google may reject or delay approval.
I can generate ready-to-use HTML pages for these if you want — just say “yes, make AdSense pages for my site.”

✅ 3. Content Quality
Your site content should:

Be original — not copied from other pension calculators or government sites.

Have minimum 15–20 unique posts/pages (even if small tools or explanations).

Include text content explaining how the calculator works, who it helps, etc.

💡 Tip: Add a few blog-style posts such as:

“How to calculate Army Pension after 7th CPC”

“What is commutation of pension?”

“How to check OROP pension details?”

✅ 4. Technical Optimization
Your site should load fast (check on https://pagespeed.web.dev).

It should work well on mobile.

Use HTTPS (your domain already has it ✅).

Have clear navigation — e.g., top or side menu with links.

✅ 5. Be patient
AdSense review can take up to 4 weeks, sometimes longer.
If you fix everything above, Google will automatically approve it.

Would you like me to:

Check your site’s pages and tell you what’s missing,

Or directly create ready AdSense pages (About, Contact, Privacy, Terms) for you to upload?

Once I know, I’ll give you exact code to copy to your website.

ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍

Let’s do this properly — please choose one option below so I can help step-by-step:

1️⃣ Check your site’s pages and tell you what’s missing
➡️ I’ll visit https://pencalculator.startknowledge.in, scan its structure, and tell you which AdSense-required pages or content are missing (e.g. Privacy Policy, About Us, etc.).

2️⃣ Create ready AdSense pages for you to upload
➡️ I’ll generate professional HTML code for:

About Us

Contact Us

Privacy Policy (AdSense-compliant)

Terms & Conditions

You’ll just copy–paste these into your website folder or upload through your hosting panel.

Which one do you want me to do first — (1) Check site or (2) Create pages?

You said:
Ok
ChatGPT said:
Great 👍 — but just to be clear, which option do you want me to start with?

👉 Type 1 to check your site and tell what’s missing,
or
👉 Type 2 to create ready AdSense pages (About, Contact, Privacy, Terms) for you to upload.

1&2
ChatGPT said:
Got it 👍 — it looks like I can’t directly open your website link from here (I can’t “click” live links myself).

But no worries — we can still do both parts easily:

🧩 Step 1: Check your site manually
Please tell me:

What pages (like “About”, “Contact”, etc.) are currently on your site?

Is your pension calculator the only page, or do you have others too?

Once you tell me that, I’ll tell you what’s missing for AdSense approval.

🧾 Step 2: Create ready AdSense pages
Even without seeing your site, I can generate ready-made HTML pages that fit perfectly.
They’ll include:

✅ About Us

✅ Contact Us

✅ Privacy Policy (AdSense-compliant)

✅ Terms & Conditions

Would you like me to generate all four HTML pages now for pencalculator.startknowledge.in?

You said:
Ok je pages one by one bana do "About Us

✅ Contact Us

✅ Privacy Policy (AdSense-compliant)

✅ Terms & Cond"
